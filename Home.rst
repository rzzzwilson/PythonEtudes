Welcome to the Python Etudes wiki!

Overview
========

This is a collection of short essays (etudes) on various subjects showing how
some problem could be solved in python.  The approach is to start very simply
and progress through various versions of a program, adding things like error
checking, better code structure, etc, as we go.

The code for the etudes is stored `here <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/PythonEtudes/>`_
and the explanatory notes are in this wiki.

Introduction
============

This etude will discuss adding two numbers together.  We are not really
interested in how you add two numbers in python, as that's boring::

    s = 1 + 2

What we are interested in here is how you approach adding two numbers
starting with a very simple command line (CLI) program with nothing in
the way of error checking.  At each new stage we will add some desirable
feature such as error checking and produce a better body of code.

Problem Description
-------------------

Write a command line program that will ask the user for two integer numbers
and print the sum of those two numbers before finishing.

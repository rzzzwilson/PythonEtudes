This etude is about building a clone of the
`Battleship game <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Battleship_(game)>`_.

The implementation will start out as a commandline program that runs on
a single computer.  Later development could add a GUI version.  It is also
possible to make the CLI and GUI versions play over the network or internet.

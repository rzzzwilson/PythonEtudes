Welcome to the Python Etudes wiki!

Overview
========

This is a collection of short essays (etudes) on various subjects showing how
some problem could be solved in python.  The approach is to start very simply
and progress through various versions of a program, adding things like error
checking, better code structure, etc, as we go.  Along the way we will
demonstrate common errors often tripped over by beginners.

The code for the etudes is stored
`here <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/PythonEtudes/>`_ and the explanatory notes
for each etude are in this wiki.

All code is written for python 3.6 or later.

From CLI to GUI
===============

This etude is concerned with adding two numbers together, starting with a CLI
implementation, progressing through various levels of sophistication and then
moving into a GUI solution, using tkinter.  The notes start
`here <https://github.com/rzzzwilson/PythonEtudes/wiki/From_CLI_to_GUI/From_CLI_to_GUI.0>`_.
